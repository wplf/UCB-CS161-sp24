# cs161-sp24

Hello there!
This is the implementation of the course CS161 at the University of California, Berkeley, which is a course on computer security.

In project 1, you will learn how to use the gbd debugger and exploit the vulnerability in the C program. And I am still working on it.
The environment can be downloaded from the [link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1M_zCQjZMHPhQkSeLPR-jyzNWs2Yd4od-/view?usp=sharing)
