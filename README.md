# UCB-CS161-sp24

Hello there!
This is the implementation of the course CS161 about computer security, offered by UCB.

In project 1, you will learn how to use the gbd debugger and exploit the vulnerability in the C program. And I am still working on it.

The requriment can be found in the [textbook](https://sp24.cs161.org/proj1/getting-started/).The environment can be downloaded from the [pwnable-sp24.ova](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1M_zCQjZMHPhQkSeLPR-jyzNWs2Yd4od-/view?usp=sharing)
